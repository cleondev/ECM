# Repository Guidelines

- All .NET projects in this repository must target **.NET 9.0**. Do not downgrade project `TargetFramework` values to earlier versions.
- When adjusting code for compatibility, prefer retaining C# 13 features already in use (e.g., collection expressions, enhanced pattern matching).
- Update this file if additional cross-cutting conventions are introduced.
