# Share Link Architecture Overview

This document outlines the high level architecture for the secure short link sharing feature.

## Database Objects

The PostgreSQL migration defined in `database/07_share.sql` introduces the `file.share_link` table for share metadata, `file.share_access_event` for auditing, and the `file.share_stats` materialized view for aggregated statistics. The schema follows the requirements in the product specification, including validity windows, quotas, password hashing storage, and IP allow lists.

## Short Code Generation

Short link codes use a cryptographically strong base62 alphabet. The `Shared.Utilities.ShortCode.ShortCodeGenerator` class provides helpers to generate random codes between 6 and 16 characters as well as deterministic conversion from binary identifiers (e.g. ULIDs) to shorter textual representations.

## API & Backend Responsibilities

* Resolve `code → share_link.id` with uniqueness enforced at the database level.
* Expose `/api/ecm/shares` CRUD endpoints for administrators to create, update, revoke, and inspect share links together with `/shares/{id}/stats` materialized view lookups.
* Provide public endpoints `/s/{code}` (interstitial), `/s/{code}/password`, `/s/{code}/presign`, and `/s/{code}/download` that orchestrate password validation, quota tracking, presigned URL generation, and safe redirects.
* Validate revocation, validity window, subject authorization, password checks, quota limits, and optional IP filtering before serving the interstitial or download redirect.
* Persist access events in `file.share_access_event` for every view/download/password failure and refresh the `file.share_stats` materialized view to drive reporting.
* Generate presigned GET URLs against MinIO for each approved download, with a configurable 5–15 minute TTL and without exposing storage URLs before authorization completes.

## Frontend Interstitial Flow

* Anonymous visitors access `/s/{code}` and the Next.js page fetches metadata via the backend interstitial API.
* When a share is password-protected, the client renders a password form, invokes `/s/{code}/password` for validation, and refreshes the interstitial state once the password is accepted.
* The download button calls `/s/{code}/presign`, receives `{ url, expiresAtUtc }`, and navigates the browser to the presigned URL so the file streams directly from MinIO.

## Security Considerations

* Passwords are stored with Argon2id.
* Rate limiting is applied per IP + code.
* Response headers enforce `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
* Presigned URLs are short lived and scoped to GET only.

## Future Work

* Surface share statistics and management tooling in the administration UI.
* Automate refresh of the materialized view after access events.
* Integrate watermarking and more granular IP allow list enforcement in the download flow.
